The SquatNotes Browser Extension is a companion to the [SquatNotes desktop app](https://www.vincela.com/squatnotes/) which allows you to take notes while browsing the web, and then save them when you are ready.

## Installing

SquatNotes is compatible with Chrome and Chrome-like browsers (such as Brave or Edge).

There are no plans to release this to the Chrome Web Store because Google sucks.

### Manual Install Instructions
1. Download a release bundle from the **Releases** section of this repository
2. Unzip that release
3. Go to your browser's **Extensions** settings and enable **Developer Mode**

4. Click "Load Unpacked" and find your unzipped bundle
5. Take notes!
